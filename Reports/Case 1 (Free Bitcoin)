## 3. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- **Suspicious URL:** https://www.uschovna.cz/en/zasilka/TNWFE8WBHDI2RME6-83S  
- **Reply-To Email:** bp1qcej6n9@gmail.com

---

## 4. Analysis
**Header Findings**  
- SPF and DKIM passed, but DMARC failed due to no DMARC policy on the domain.  
- Reply-To address (`bp1qcej6n9@gmail.com`) did not match the From address (`uschovna.cz`).  

**Reputation Checks**  
- **VirusTotal (domain):** Mixed results, some engines flagged suspicious.  
- **URLScan:** Resolved to a hosted download page, offering a “wallet backup” file.  
- **AbuseIPDB:** IP previously reported for spam/phishing activity.  
- **Talos:** Poor sender IP reputation.  

**Delivery Method**  
- No direct attachment was present. Instead, the email linked to an external file download, a technique used to bypass email attachment filtering.  

**Lure Tactic**  
- Promise of “free Bitcoin” as financial incentive.  
- Urgency: *“Your backup is the key to your funds.”*

## 5. Conclusion
- **Classification:** Phishing / Malware Delivery  
- **Risk Level:** High  
- **Assessment:**  
  The email was a malicious attempt to deliver malware through an external link. Spoofed headers, failed DMARC compliance, mismatched reply-to, and external payload hosting confirm phishing intent.
